# 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Capstone Project: **AVIR**

## 📌 Project Idea  
**AVIR** is a MERN-stack based web application designed to help parents—especially working or single parents—build stronger emotional connections with their children despite busy schedules. It includes features like personalized notes, reminders, mood check-ins, activity suggestions, and group chats for parents, siblings, and friends. This platform encourages daily engagement and bonding in a safe and simple digital space.

## 📝 Brief Description  
The platform allows parents to send notes, set reminders, and suggest fun bonding activities. Children can respond with reactions, mood check-ins, and messages. Users can form private groups to stay connected with family and friends. With a user-friendly interface and role-based dashboards, FamilyConnect promotes mindful parenting and emotional well-being in everyday life.
